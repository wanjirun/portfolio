      I love to travel! Traveling is the best way to learn about the world and your place in it. If I were to pick a career,
      I would choose the life of a digital nomad. Travelling all over the world, creating digital content and partnering with
      brands that specialize in the health and well-being of their consumers.

    <p> <em> I love the idea of creating digital content from scratch. I want to be able to create apps and websites from the beginning.
      I also love a challenge, programming and coding is an admimirable skill.</em>
