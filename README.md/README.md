I am Wanjiru Nganga, I am twenty-three years old born in Nairobi, Kenya. When I was seven years old, my family and I moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in hopes of fulfilling the American dream. After a few years, my parents grew homesick and we moved to Lilongwe Malawi. Throughout out the years, I went to high school in Johannesburg, Kenya and Malawi. When I was eighteen, I moved to Canada to pursue a degree in Marketing. I lived in Canada for five years. As of September, I have moved back to Nairobi.
